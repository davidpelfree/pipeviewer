Things still to do:

  * get alternative Polish translation for "ETA"
  * build fixes on Slackware 8.0
  * make sure Solaris and BSD building still works
  * make doing "pv" then ^Z then "bg" then "fg" not need another "fg"
  * translations (please email me if you speak another language!)

Any assistance would be appreciated.
