Things still to do:

  - Debian bug #415652: wishlist item: option to count lines, not bytes
  - fix cursor positioning (-c) lockfiles when O_EXLOCK is unavailable
  - fix cursor positioning (-c) to use semaphores instead of locking
  - if the first pv exits, should the second become IPC leader?
  - get more translations

Any assistance would be appreciated.
