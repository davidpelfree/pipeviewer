Things still to do:

  - fix potential NULL deref in transfer.c:243 (Elias Pipping / LLVM/Clang)
  - add development support for http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html
  - fix cursor positioning (-c) lockfiles when O_EXLOCK is unavailable
  - fix cursor positioning (-c) to use semaphores instead of locking
  - if the first pv exits, should the second become IPC leader?
  - get more translations

Any assistance would be appreciated.
