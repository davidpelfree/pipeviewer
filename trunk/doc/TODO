Things still to do:

  - fix cursor positioning (-c) to use semaphores instead of locking
  - option -F to read list of files to use from a file
  - another option to read list of files terminated by NULL not newline
  - if the first pv exits, should the second become IPC leader?
  - get more translations

Any assistance would be appreciated.
