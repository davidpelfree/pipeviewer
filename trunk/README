Introduction
************

This is the README for `pv' ("Pipe Viewer"), a terminal-based tool for
monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline.  It can be inserted into
any normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how
quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to
completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion.


Documentation
*************

An Info file, manual page, and an HTML manual are all included in this
distribution.  If you have a web browser such as `lynx' handy, you may view
the file `doc/index.html' to get started.  If you prefer plain text, then
look at `doc/quickref.txt' to see the manual page.


Compilation
***********

To compile the package, type "sh ./configure", which should generate a
Makefile for your system.  You may then type "make" to build everything.

See the file `doc/INSTALL' for more about the `configure' script.

Developers note that you can do "./configure --enable-debug" to cause
debugging support to be built in.  Also note that doing "make index" will
generate an HTML code index (using "ctags" and "cproto"); this index lists
all files used, all functions defined, and all TODOs marked in the code.
