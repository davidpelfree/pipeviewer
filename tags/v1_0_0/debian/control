Description: Shell pipeline element to meter data passing through
 pv (Pipe Viewer) can be inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes
 to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing through, how long it
 has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be
 until completion.
 .
 To use it, insert it in a pipeline between two processes, with the appropriate
 options. Its standard input will be passed through to its standard output and
 progress will be shown on standard error.
