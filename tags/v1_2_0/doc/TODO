Things still to do:

  - fix install on OSes without man page .gz (Bob Friesenhahn)
  - integrate Sami Liedes patch for numeric with timer and bytes

    10:15:30s"
  - fix -c answerback on Solaris 10 (Bob Friesenhahn)
  - add -m (line count, block buffer) patch (E. Rosten)
  - add -O to allow ordering of -pterb output, eg -bertp (Vladimir Pal)

  - look at effect of O_SYNC or fsync on performance
  - add development support for http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html
  - look at splice syscall (Коренберг Марк / socketpair)
  - fix cursor positioning (-c) lockfiles when O_EXLOCK is unavailable

  - get more translations

Any assistance would be appreciated.
